            The Greek here (<span class="greek">σημαίνω</span>) can be compared with English "semaphore," a traffic signal.  The red, yellow, and green light protocol familiar to most in the culture of the US would mean nothing to a person from a completely different culture--there is no natural or inherent meaning to the colors or sequence or number, etc.  But as the familiar traffic light is used everywhere from waiting rooms to classrooms because it is familiar, so also are the symbols of the Revelation familiar to the culture of God's people: they all have their origin in the rest of the Scriptures.

                "And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."  He said this to <em>show</em> by what kind of death he was going to die.

                "Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go." (This he said to <em>show</em> by what kind of death he was to glorify God.)
