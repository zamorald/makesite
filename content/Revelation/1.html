            The Greek here (<span class="greek">σημαίνω</span>) can be compared with English "semaphore," a traffic signal.  The red, yellow, and green light protocol familiar to most in the culture of the US would mean nothing to a person from a completely different culture--there is no natural or inherent meaning to the colors or sequence or number, etc.  But as the familiar traffic light is used everywhere from waiting rooms to classrooms because it is familiar, so also are the symbols of the Revelation familiar to the culture of God's people: they all have their origin in the rest of the Scriptures.

        Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of <em>Melchizedek</em>, rather than one named after the order of <em>Aaron</em>?
        For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.
        For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
        For it is evident that our Lord was descended from <em>Judah</em>, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.

Who among them has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he shall perform his purpose on Babylon, and his arm shall be against the Chaldeans.
        <br>
        Go out from Babylon, flee from Chaldea, declare this with a shout of joy, proclaim it, send it out to the end of the earth; say, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob!"

        God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him, "I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption...."
        <br>
        For he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.

        This perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written:<br>
        "Death is swallowed up in victory."<br>
