            Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.

                Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both sides; <em>on the front and on the back they were written</em>.

                And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. And he spread it before me. And <em>it had writing on the front and on the back</em>, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.

                I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.

                The side that was written on was the horizontal side, which was called a recto, where the fibers were parallel to the length of the roll and lines of writing. Writing on the verso or vertical side was unusual, but was still acceptable. A scroll was usually only written on one side unless the scroll was reused, becoming a palimpsest or a piece of writing material where the original writing was washed off and new writing was made.

                In textual studies, a palimpsest is a manuscript page, either from a scroll or a book, from which the text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document. Parchment was made of lamb, calf, or goat kid skin and was expensive and not readily available, so in the interest of economy a page was often re-used by scraping off the previous writing.
