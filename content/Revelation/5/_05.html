            And one of the elders said to me, "Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.

                Judah, your brothers shall praise you;                <br>
                your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies;       <br>
                your father's sons shall bow down before you.         <br>
                Judah is a lion's cub;                                <br>
                from the prey, my son, you have gone up.              <br>
                He stooped down; he crouched as a lion                <br>
                and as a lioness; who dares rouse him?                <br>
                The scepter shall not depart from Judah,              <br>
                nor the ruler's staff from between his feet,          <br>
                until tribute comes to him;                           <br>
                and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.     <br>
                Binding his foal to the vine                          <br>
                and his donkey's colt to the choice vine,             <br>
                he has washed his garments in wine                    <br>
                and his vesture in the blood of grapes.               <br>
                His eyes are darker than wine,                        <br>
                and his teeth whiter than milk.                       <br>

                There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit. And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
                <br>
                They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea. In that day the root of Jesse, who shall stand as a signal for the peoples--of him shall the nations inquire, and his resting place shall be glorious.

                I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name."
                <br>
                And again Isaiah says, "The root of Jesse will come, even he who arises to rule the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles hope."

                Everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world--our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
